coding environment
<br/>
-Android Studio
<br/>
-VS Code
<br/>
-flutter

<br/>
I recommend using VS Code.

VS Code can use the autocomplete function regardless of lowercase or uppercase letters, but Android Studio does not support it. Each has its pros and cons, so use it at your own risk.

Some parts have changed in Flutter 2.0, so you can feel a sense of heterogeneity. I don't know about VS Code, but Android Studio supports it in the IDE so that it can be changed easily enough.
