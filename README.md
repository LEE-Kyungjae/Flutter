<About Flutter><br/>
This is the code I coded following I referenced various documents and YouTube.<br/>

-Android Studio
<br/>
-VS Code
<br/>
-flutter
<br/>
-dart
<br/>
I recommend using VS Code.

VS Code can use the autocomplete function regardless of lowercase or uppercase letters, but Android Studio does not support it. Each has its pros and cons, so use it at your own risk.
